# 1. Metamaterial Thermal Emitter design

## Description:

Metamaterials are engineered from assemblies of multiple elements to have properties not found in naturally occurring substances.

To compose a metamaterial - composite materials such as metals and plastics are usually arranged in repeating patterns.

Specific shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement makes metamaterials able to affect waves of electromagnetic radiation or sound in a manner not observed in bulk materials.

One can optimize efficiency of Metamaterial Thermal Emitter by adjusting structure and shape of its patterns.

Potential applications of metamaterials include:

* Optical filters
* Medical devices
* Remote aerospace applications
* Sensor detection and infrastructure monitoring
* Smart solar power management
* Negative-index metamaterials
* Lasers
* Lenses for high-gain antennas
* Super-lenses
* High-frequency communication 
* Ultrasonic sensors
* And even shielding structures for earthquake protection

# 2. Metamaterial Antenna design

## Description:

Metamaterial antennas use novel, often microscopic, structures to produce unusual physical properties. 

Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can improve radiated power level or spacial power distribution defined by power diagram.

Potential applications of metamaterial antennas can include:

* All types of wireless communication
* Space communications
* Wide angle beam steering
* Micro-sensors
* And even portable ground-penetrating radars to search for geophysical features

Optimization of Metamaterial Antenna patterns and shape can improve efficiency in scope of bandwith and power diagram.
